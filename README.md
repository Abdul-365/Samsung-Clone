# Samsung-Clone
A responsive website that replicates the user interface of Samsungâ€™s homepage. The website was built using Bootstrap to ensure that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

Makes good use of Bootstrap components such as offcanvas navbar, carousel and pills which have also been customized to make them even better.

Also makes use of the CSS clamp function to make the text written on top of images responsive. It helps the text scale according to the size of the viewport.
